If anyone in my family is reading this, understand that while my beliefs are
different, I am still the same person. Our connection by blood can be
stronger than any other. Please understand this.

For Christians (especially members of the LDS church) that are reading this,
understand that we are all people, and while we may have different beliefs
our collective human experience matters so much more than that difference.
Be respectful and don't proselate or go somewhere else. This can be triggering.

My religous experience has been one hell of a time, and I think that it is
important to share for other people to find. Or at least put my feelings out
into the void.

Context: While I don't necessarily have a label for my religous belief, I am 
looking to practice Norse Paganism, more specifically a version
that is is based on reconstructionism or based heavily on historical findings
in the way that is trying to follow how people originally practiced the
religion. By no means am I doing this "accurately" or am going to be a complete
reconstructionist. This is just the method that I am going about researching
it. I have been looking into it on and off for about a year or so, and begun
pursuing the Path around 5 days ago. I am very new.

## Before

#### Warning: Discussion of mental health, depression, suicide

This section describes a lot of my personal experience with the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints (also known as the Mormon or LDS church), be
warned if it is mundane or uses bizarre language. It is a thought out Christian
religion. This is also not not meant to be a bash on the church, just (again)
my personal experience.

The states have a reputation for being many things. One state, Utah, in
particular is also notorious for a lot of reasons. It is known for its gorgeous
mountains that scrape the sky with snow, other beautiful scenery, a small
small portion of the US tech industry, and of course, Mormonism. I am no
exception to this stereotype. I was born in Utah's capital of Salt Lake City
to loving religous parents, as well as extended family that were also members.
My family is by no means rich. A lower middle class family with a stay-at-home
mom (for the most part), a father whose arms we would rush to as soon as he got
back from work, and my siblings and I who would go to school and do the normal
kid things that other kids do. We have always had what we needed. 
I went to church every Sunday with the rest of my family. This is just
an average story. I did not experience observable trauma in the church, 
have a family that still loves me to this day, and still live in the community
I spent most of my childhood in (although the environment is different). What
changed? What is different?

This story does not tell everything in its enirety and removes a lot of the
nuance. It is true that I genuinely have a family that loves me very much,
which is sadly an experience that not all members of the LDS church have.
Gatekeeping, justification, and excusing are all things that members have done
with their belief being that it is through the truth and the light.
While these are all actions that have been done by Christians for centuries,
the Mormon church has a different flavor that is very prevalent in our modern
day. It has become a vehicle for bad people to do bad things.

I think I first started experiencing my adversity throughout middle and high
high school, as a lot of people do. I noticed some weird things that became hot
topics in my religion. The prophet (head honcho of the LDS church) of that time
passed a policy that the children of gay parents could not attend be baptized
become official members of the church. Business was otherwise normal. Men are
the only people who can administer the priesthood, the power and authority of
God that would leave the whole earth to be utterly wasted<sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/priesthood?lang=eng#p2">1</a></sup>.
Men cannot establish an eternal family without a woman. "In other words,
procreative power and priesthood power are shared by husband and wife." These 
were things that I just believed. Even when we ignore the modern moral
implications of this statement, it was still doctrine that did not feel right
to me. This was what I grew up in after all.

I did not have doubts in this gospel, but I did start on a rabbit hole of
mental health that would not be easy to escape. My family moved when I started
my last year of elementary school, to a district that would put me partway into
my first year of middle school. My parents are not to blame. I would not be the
I am today without this experience. This move would put both my social skills
and my confidence to complete schoolwork in a bad place. My social anxiety
spiked and I had social issues that I never really had to deal with before. I
lost contact with my small but tight group of friends was replaced with a half
connection to many kinds of people, a search for something that I once had. I
also started masking parts of myself to not appear as the person I was
(something that was not helped with an undiagnosed case of ADHD). Middle school
was not great, but I continued the love of learning and developing my hobbies.
I did not realize it would get much worse.

The first couple years of high school were pretty average. Big aspirations,
smart kid. I continued developing my hobbies. I had a much closer group of
friends, sparse few I am still friends with now. While my friend's were closer,
it was still nothing compared to what I had in elementary school. While things
were better on a surface level, I was now masking at a much deeper level. There
was not really a semblance of my authentic self in social situations. While I
do not know where it came from, there was also a belief that social connections
could only be maintained like a trade that had to be maintained, and that I was
not a person with intrisic worth even though I was a living person with lived
experience.

## Later

This post has become more than what I expected it to be. An expose on my
religous standpoint evolved into a light retelling of my life's story. This is a
lot to put out there. Thanks for being here.
