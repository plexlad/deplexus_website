There is so much information that we don't know what to do with ourselves.
Having a place to write, to learn, and to grow and put our ideas out as people
is important, so thanks for being here. I've created this blog for several
reasons. Let's get into it.

We can think of information in some categories.

- Wisdom is old info. Like over 10 years old.
- Recent information is anything that is not wisdom or present information.
- Present information is very new, pretty much anything in recent memory within
    the last year.

## Nostalgia

As many people probably know that I'm going to talk about because you are
reading this on a *blog*, information has changed a lot in the last 50 years 
or so. And that is one of the biggest understatements I have said in my life.

From the days of the ARPANET, to know, many many many things have changed.
Without getting too into it, the introduction of social media has absolutely
changed the landscape of technology and the world as we know it. One of the
largest shifts that we have seen is in the way that we digest information.

While this is something you've probably heard a million times, we have an
information crisis. Never before has information been able to be exchanged this
quickly and it causes an issue. The shift in information happens because we are
now overloaded with present information and barely know what to do with it.
The decentralized internet is nearly gone.

There are a lot of people online who miss the old internet. There is a feeling
of nostalgia and reminiscing among small niche corners of the internet. It's
not that I am not excited for new technologies, or just a grumpy old man complaining
about kids these days. There is just a sense of community and having total freedom
that is so awesome. No massive company that has created a synthetic version of
me to estimate how to take my time and money. No comments, or replies, or follows,
or likes. No mental health breakdowns or synthetic happiness. Just my stuff.
The things that I like, I people I want to be around. Just a place to scream
into the void while enjoying the good aspects of humanity.

As somebody who never grew up in that era, I honestly miss it.

## Privacy

Technology has also become a little invasive over the years. The avatars I
talked about earlier? Those are actually real, and a phrase that is used by
people in the marketing industry. 

I am not here to freak you out over the use of information by large companies.
It's just my personal preference.

## Functionality

//TODO: Less distractions

In honesty, this is just my justification for my personal preference over
anything else. The world will still move on as it always has. That's about it.

This is my opinion. Thanks for listening.
